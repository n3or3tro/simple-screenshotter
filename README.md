# simple screenshotter
Capture, and intelligently store screenshots, simply! Lives in your toolbar (:

### Motive
1. I want to learn Rust, this seems like a useful, not-too-hard of a task. 
2. I remember more than 1 person mentioning at work to be aware because the common
screenshotting tool they used was actually spyware.
3. I always wanted a screenshotter with a "session" mode where you can
set it to store all hence-forth screenshots in a specific place, and then
easilly alter the location / end this behaviour.

I want it to be cross platform, with as much common code for the internals, as possible.

If there is a cross-platform tool bar app library, then I'd try use that. 
I imagine there isn't tho, so I may just write 3 native variants.
